# Final_Project
Final project at The Iron Yard. 
See it here! https://store-to-door.herokuapp.com/

A collaboration with https://github.com/mcverticchio, this project was created as an ordering and delivery platform. 

Customer users can add contact information, browse grocery items, look for nearby stores, add items to a cart, 
send the list up to the driver users. Search items are pulled through the Supermarket API. 
Driver users can mark lists as complete or in progress.
The original concept was to assist the elderly, so we took care to make it clear and simple to use. 

To get the app running locally, install requirements.txt, set up a Python 3 virtual enviroment, set a Django secret key in settings, and get an API key for the Supermarket API.
